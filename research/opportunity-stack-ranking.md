## Investment Allocation Strategy

### For $250-400K Household:
1. **40%** - Opportunity Zone fund (rural focus)
2. **30%** - Angel investments in pre-Title IV bootcamps
3. **20%** - Critical minerals venture fund
4. **10%** - Agricultural REIT or farmland fund

### For Institutional Investors:
1. **35%** - Critical minerals processing facilities
2. **25%** - Workforce training roll-up
3. **20%** - Rural Opportunity Zone development
4. **20%** - Agricultural technology and land

### For Entrepreneurs:
1. **First Choice**: Workforce training in underserved vertical
2. **Second Choice**: Critical minerals trading/logistics
3. **Third Choice**: AgTech leveraging new subsidies

## Why This Ranking?

**Opportunity Zones win** because they're permanent, immediate, and have a 3x rural arbitrage few understand.

**Critical Minerals rank high** due to government desperation to break China dependency - they'll overpay and guarantee returns.

**Workforce Pell Grants** have massive TAM but require 18-month setup, hence #3.

**Traditional defense/border** ranks low because everyone sees it, competition is fierce, and politics add risk.

## Key Insight

The best opportunities in OBBB aren't the obvious ones (defense, border) but the permanent structural changes (OZ, QSBS) and strategic necessities (critical minerals, workforce). The smart money is moving into these spaces NOW, while others fight over defense contracts.
