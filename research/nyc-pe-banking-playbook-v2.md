# NYC Private Equity & Banking Opportunity Playbook v2.0 - OBBB
*Updated with comprehensive non-defense opportunity analysis*

## Executive Summary - What Changed
Initial analysis focused on defense/border plays. Deep dive revealed **$50B+ in non-defense opportunities** including permanent tax programs, massive agricultural subsidies, and critical minerals funding. These discoveries fundamentally change the investment thesis.

## Tier 1: Highest Conviction Plays

### 1. Agricultural Technology Roll-Up
**Why This is #1:**
- **$15B+ annual funding** across multiple programs
- 30 million new base acres = massive subsidy expansion
- $5B+ conservation programs need tech solutions
- $285M export promotion creates global opportunities

**NYC Strategy:**
1. **AgTech Fund**: $500M-$1B
   - Target: Precision farming companies
   - Thesis: Help farmers maximize new subsidies
   - Exit: Strategic buyers (Deere, Monsanto)
   
2. **Conservation Tech Platform**
   - Build SaaS for $5B conservation compliance
   - Subscription model: $50K/farm
   - Target: 10,000 farms = $500M revenue

2. **Processing Platform Roll-up**
   - Consolidate small processors
   - Access $5B in federal investments
   - Exit to major miners

## Tier 2: Sector-Specific Plays
