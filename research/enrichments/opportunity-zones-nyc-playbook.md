#### Example Deal Stack: 1,000-Acre Ranch Purchase

**Purchase Price**: $800,000 ($800/acre)
**OZ Investment**: Defer $800,000 in capital gains

**Revenue Streams**:
1. **CBP Facility Lease**: 50 acres × $10,000/acre/year = $500,000
2. **Agricultural Base Acres**: 500 acres × $200/acre = $100,000
3. **Conservation Payments**: 400 acres × $50/acre = $20,000
4. **Mineral Rights Lease**: $50,000/year option payment
5. **Total Annual Income**: $670,000 (84% cap rate!)

**5-Year Projection**:
- Annual income: $670,000 × 5 = $3,350,000
- Land appreciation (3x): $2,400,000 value
- Total return: $5,750,000 on $800,000 (619% pre-tax)
- After-tax with OZ: Keep it all!

### Phase 4: Exit Strategies for Different Hold Periods

#### Year 5 Exit (Minimum for Basis Increase)
**Tax Treatment**:
- 30% of original gain forgiven
- Pay tax on 70% of deferred gain
- Pay capital gains on appreciation

**Best For**: 
- Quick flips on border infrastructure plays
- Developed properties with immediate cash flow
- Investors needing earlier liquidity

**Example**: 
$1M gain deferred → Save $300K in taxes → 2x appreciation = $2M
Net after-tax: ~$1.6M (vs $1.2M without OZ)

#### Year 10 Exit (Optimal Tax Efficiency)
**Tax Treatment**:
- Original gain taxed (less 30% basis increase)
- ALL appreciation is tax-free
- Step-up basis to fair market value

**Best For**:
- Long-term development plays
- Agricultural operations
- Mining/energy projects

**Example**:
$1M gain deferred → 5x appreciation = $5M
Net after-tax: $4.7M (vs $3.2M without OZ)

#### Year 20-30 Exit (Generational Wealth)
**Tax Treatment**:
- Same as Year 10 (tax-free appreciation)
- Massive compound growth
- Estate planning benefits

**Best For**:
- Family compound development
- Large agricultural operations
- Mineral rights plays

**Example**:
$1M → 10x over 20 years = $10M tax-free
Pass to heirs with stepped-up basis

## The Bottom Line: Why This Window Won't Last

**Supply Constraints**:
- Limited rural OZ designations
- Best properties selling fast
- Local partners getting sophisticated
- Institutional money arriving

**Demand Surge Coming**:
- $2T+ in unrealized gains seeking shelter
- Urban OZ disappointments driving rural interest
- Federal spending creating visible success stories
- Media attention building

**The Math That Matters**:
Traditional taxable investment of $400K:
- Pay ~$95K in capital gains tax
- Invest $305K
- 2x in 5 years = $610K
- Pay tax on $305K gain = ~$72K
- Net: $538K

Rural OZ investment of $400K:
- Defer all taxes, invest full $400K
- 3x in 5 years = $1.2M (federal tailwinds)
- 30% basis increase saves $28K
- Continue to year 10: 5x = $2M
- Exit tax-free
- Net: $2M (3.7x more!)

**This is the opportunity of a lifetime for NYC investors willing to think beyond Manhattan.**
