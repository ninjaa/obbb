# The $75M QSBS Arbitrage: How to Turn the 7.5X Expansion into Generational Wealth

## Executive Summary for NYC Sophisticated Investors

The QSBS exemption expansion from $10M to $75M isn't just a tax break - it's the largest wealth-building arbitrage opportunity in a generation. This guide shows how to structure investments, stack incentives, and build funds that maximize this 7.5X increase in tax-free gains.

**Key Insight**: At $75M tax-free per taxpayer, a single successful investment can create more after-tax wealth than most private equity funds deliver in a decade.

## Part 1: Structuring for Maximum $75M Capture

### The Original Issuance Architecture

**Critical Requirements**:
1. Stock must be newly issued by C-corporation
2. Acquired directly from company (not secondary)
3. Post-December 31, 2026 acquisition
4. 5-year minimum holding period
5. Company must pass gross asset test (<$50M)

### SPV Structure for Clean Pass-Through

```
NYC Investor
    ↓
Delaware Series LLC (SPV)
[Taxed as Partnership]
    ↓
Portfolio C-Corp
[Issues QSBS Stock]
```

**Benefits**:
- Clean K-1 pass-through of QSBS character
- No UBTI for tax-exempt partners
- Allows multiple investor participation
- Preserves individual $75M caps

### Deal Documentation Must-Haves

**Term Sheet Language**:
"Issuer shall deliver stock certificates or electronic book-entry evidencing original issuance under Section 1202. Company represents that it qualifies as a Qualified Small Business under IRC Section 1202 and will provide annual certifications."

**Subscription Agreement Additions**:
- Timestamp all documents post-2026
- Board minutes reflecting issuance
- Company QSBS representation letter
- Annual gross asset test certification

## Part 2: The Stacking Playbook - QSBS + Everything

### QSBS × R&D Tax Credits
**Structure**: Portfolio company with heavy R&D spend
**Stack**: 
- QSBS on equity gains (0% federal tax)
- R&D credits reduce operating tax burden
- Section 174 5-year amortization benefit
**Result**: Tax-efficient operations + tax-free exit

### QSBS × Opportunity Zones
**Complex but Powerful**:
1. Form C-Corp Qualified Opportunity Zone Business (QOZB)
2. Issue QSBS stock for new capital
3. Deploy capital in Opportunity Zone
4. Stack benefits:
   - OZ: Defer initial gains + 10% basis increase
   - QSBS: $75M tax-free on exit
**Challenge**: Must maintain 90% QOZ asset test

### QSBS × State Credits
**NYC Reality**: New York doesn't conform to federal QSBS
**Workaround**: 
- Establish holding company in QSBS-friendly state
- Nevada, Florida, Texas, Washington = no state tax
- Wyoming, South Dakota = favorable trust laws
**Benefit**: Preserve full federal benefit

### QSBS × Carried Interest
**For Fund Managers**:
- Ensure carry holders get QSBS allocation
- Each GP/carry holder has own $75M cap
- Structure carry as profits interest in SPV
- Document 5-year holding period carefully

## Part 3: Fund Formation Architecture

### The QSBS Preservation Fund Structure

```
Limited Partners (Individuals)
    ↓
Master Fund LP
[Delaware Limited Partnership]
    ↓
Multiple Single-Asset SPVs
[Each holds one QSBS investment]
    ↓
Portfolio Companies
[C-Corps issuing QSBS]
```

**Why This Works**:
- Preserves QSBS character through to LPs
- Each LP uses their personal $75M exemption
- Clean K-1 reporting of QSBS gains
- Allows co-investment rights

### GP Compensation in QSBS Context

**Traditional 2/20 Becomes More Valuable**:
- 20% carry on tax-free gains
- If fund returns $375M on $75M invested
- GP carry = $60M tax-free (under $75M cap)
- Effective carry rate = 32% after-tax equivalent

### Anti-Aggregation Planning

**Avoid Related-Party Traps**:
- Spouses can each claim $75M (total $150M)
- Minor children aggregate with parents
- Trusts need careful structuring
- No brother-sister aggregation
**Strategy**: Use separate SPVs for family members

## Part 4: Target Sectors & Return Profiles

### Deep Tech & Life Sciences
**Why Perfect for QSBS**:
- Long development cycles align with 5-year hold
- High cash burn keeps under $50M gross assets
- Binary outcomes create $75M+ gains
**Target Profile**:
- Series A/B rounds at $25-100M valuations
- 5-7 year exit horizons
- 10-50X return potential

### Enterprise AI/SaaS
**Predictable QSBS Winners**:
- Recurring revenue = predictable growth
- Asset-light keeps under threshold
- Strategic acquirer universe
**Sweet Spot**:
- $3-10M ARR at entry
- $5-20M investment
- 5-10X exit multiples

### Climate Tech with Federal Support
**Stacking Opportunity**:
- QSBS + ARPA-E grants
- QSBS + DOE loan guarantees
- QSBS + Investment Tax Credits
**Risk Mitigation**: Federal funding de-risks technology

### Secondary-to-Primary Conversions
**Creative Structure**:
1. Identify secondary seller
2. Negotiate company "reload" issuance
3. Buy secondary + company issues new shares
4. Result: QSBS status on previously-secondary stock
**Use Case**: Late-stage winners approaching IPO

## Part 5: The Math That Changes Everything

### Scenario 1: Traditional VC Investment
**Investment**: $5M at $25M valuation (20%)
**Exit**: $250M acquisition (10X)
**Gross Gain**: $50M
**Federal Tax** (23.8%): -$11.9M
**State Tax** (NY 10.9%): -$5.45M
**Net Gain**: $32.65M

### Scenario 2: Same Investment with QSBS
**Investment**: $5M at $25M valuation (20%)
**Exit**: $250M acquisition (10X)
**Gross Gain**: $50M
**Federal Tax**: $0 (under $75M cap)
**State Tax**: -$5.45M (if in NY)
**Net Gain**: $44.55M (+36% more)

### Scenario 3: QSBS in No-Tax State
**Same facts but Nevada-based holding**:
**Net Gain**: $50M (+53% vs traditional)

### IRR Impact Analysis
**6-Year Hold to $50M Gain**:
- Traditional: 47.4% gross → 35.2% net IRR
- QSBS (NY): 47.4% gross → 41.8% net IRR
- QSBS (NV): 47.4% gross → 47.4% net IRR
**Improvement**: +600-1200 bps to net IRR

## Part 6: Advanced Strategies

### The Serial QSBS Stack
**Year 1-5**: Investment A ($5M → $40M)
**Year 6**: Sell A tax-free, reinvest in B
**Year 6-11**: Investment B ($40M → $200M)
**Total Gain**: $195M (first $75M tax-free)
**Strategy**: Chain QSBS investments for compound tax-free growth

### The Family Office Maximizer
**Structure**: 
- Husband: $75M cap via Trust A
- Wife: $75M cap via Trust B  
- Dynasty Trust: Potential additional $75M
- Total Family: Up to $225M tax-free
**Implementation**: Separate SPVs, clean documentation

### The GP Syndicate Play
**For Emerging Managers**:
- Raise $20M fund
- Target 5-6 QSBS investments
- Syndicate overflow to LPs as co-invest
- Each deal in separate SPV
- Preserve everyone's $75M caps

### The Late-Stage Arbitrage
**Find**: Private companies at $300M-1B valuations
**Structure**: Secondary purchase with primary overlay
**Key**: Must stay under $50M gross assets
**Play**: Many unicorns have inflated valuations but low assets
